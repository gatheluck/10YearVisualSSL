"""Feature-extraction provider for 33_pirl.

`bin/extract-features.py` discovers this file and calls `extract_val_features`
to obtain one raw feature vector per image over a dataset split. It is a thin
wrapper that reuses this method's own pieces, so the knowledge of how PIRL
turns an image into a vector stays in one place:

- the frozen encoder is rebuilt from `encoder.pt` by the adapter's
  `load_encoder`, then read through `get_encoder()` (the avg-pooled 2048-d
  ResNet-50 trunk feature; the image/jigsaw projection heads are excluded);
- images go through the method's own deterministic eval pipeline
  (`_build_loader`: bilinear resize + centre crop, ImageNet mean/std
  normalisation -- PIRL's ResNet-50 trunk trained on normalised inputs);
- features are the raw encoder output (`extract_features`), *before* the
  probe's mean-centre + L2-normalise. Raw features are what the visualisation
  asked for.

Imports are bare module names resolved through this method's directory, as the
adapter itself does. That is safe because the driver runs each method in
isolation; do not rely on this module and another method's `adapter`/`models`
coexisting in one interpreter.
